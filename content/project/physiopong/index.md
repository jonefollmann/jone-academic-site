This project describes a solution computing based on the context of the Serious Game, to support in the process of physical rehabilitation of patients amputees of upper limbs. Therefore, when we developed a serious game PhysioPong, we expect that the proposal serves as a training tool, integrated into the technical monitoring of electromyography signal to assist in the early stages of the rehabilitation process of these patients. Thistraining as physically strengthens the muscles so that they can later be protected, as well as provide the patient with a motivatorenvironment for the treatment. Furthermore, another tool functionalityis to create an environment for physical therapists to follow the progress of these individuals over the rehabilitation process. Nowadays, serious games have had been employed as a tool that can be used for several purposes, bringing a ludic experience ofthe players. The PhysioPong was developed by using the Unity game engine, combined with a sensor node module that aims tocollect data from the myoelectric signals generates by a muscular contraction of an individual, being possible to perform actions ina game. To further measure the present purpose have been performing a usability test, furthermore scientific experiments withamputees patients. These experiments were carried together by physiotherapists of the physic rehabilitation service. The evaluation performed about the tool indicated promising results with a usability and mechanic appropriated, basing the use of PhysioPong.
